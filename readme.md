## Introduction

>There is a lot of time taken and cost spent on travelling to and from school to attend face to face class lecture. Some students are scheduled to a three hours lecture a day for only three days a week. Some students have trouble approaching lecturers with questions on face to face, non-availability of universities in rural and urban areas, students may be expected to buy compulsory textbooks and attendance times can be inconvenient for some students. There is also high infrastructure cost of building. All this can be done efficiently on an e-learning system.
